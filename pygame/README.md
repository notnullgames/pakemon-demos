# Pak√©mon

This is a framework for gamifying hacking things around you. It's written in python & [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

## development

Go check out system dependencies & reference:

* [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

Install tools like this:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


Tasks are managed with `make`:

```sh
make help              #     show this help
make setup             #     setup dependencies
make run               #     run local copy of app
make package           #     create a pre-compiled version of app
```
