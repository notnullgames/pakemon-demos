This is a few ideas around just using regular HTML canvas to make pakemon frontend.

Eventually all but the loader should work in an API simialr to canvas (elektra, deno-canvas, etc)

You can find the current progress [here](https://notnullgames.github.io/pakemon-canvas/).

## development

run `npm start` for a live-reloading server.
